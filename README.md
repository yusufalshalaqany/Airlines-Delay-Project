### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights about airlines delayed flights and performance in 2008. By analyzing various aspects of the flights data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of every the carrier's and airport's performance.

### Data Sources

Delayed Flights Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "DelayedFlights.csv" file, containing detailed information about each flight made by every the carrier.

### Data Preparation

Collecting Related Data:
- I got 2 more files for Airports & Carriers containing more details about their codes, region and names to help me analysis data.

Python (By using Pandas): Explore and cleaning the data, I focused on three things: -

1 - Data Understanding (Types, measures and each column meaning)

2 - Check duplication and null values and replace them with suitable values by:

  - Replace all null values in times with "0" to keep the data has no time
  - Replace all null values in tail number with "Unknown" to keep the data has no numbers

3 - Minimize data storage as can as possible by:
  - Change data type from Float to Integer because all times are measured by (minutes) 

 <br />

### Data Analysis

- **Include some interesting code/features worked with Python**

1 - Import Pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
```
2 - Import DelayedFlights Dataset & Read it
```python
df = pd.read_csv("DelayedFlights.csv")
df
```
3 - Rename the first column 'unnamed' by 'ID' & Order by Asc
```python
df = df.rename(columns={"Unnamed: 0": "ID"})
df = df.sort_values(by="ID", ascending=True)
df
```

4 - Get Dataset Info Then Change Type
```python
df.info()
pd.set_option("display.max_columns", None) 
df.head(10)

df["DepTime"] = df["DepTime"].astype("Int64")
df["ArrTime"] = df["ArrTime"].astype("Int64")
df["TaxiIn"] = df["TaxiIn"].astype("Int64")
df["TaxiOut"] = df["TaxiOut"].astype("Int64")
df["ActualElapsedTime"] = df["ActualElapsedTime"].astype("Int64")
df["CRSElapsedTime"] = df["CRSElapsedTime"].astype("Int64")
df["AirTime"] = df["AirTime"].astype("Int64")
df["ArrDelay"] = df["ArrDelay"].astype("Int64")
df["DepDelay"] = df["DepDelay"].astype("Int64")
df["CarrierDelay"] = df["CarrierDelay"].astype("Int64")
df["WeatherDelay"] = df["WeatherDelay"].astype("Int64")
df["NASDelay"] = df["NASDelay"].astype("Int64")
df["SecurityDelay"] = df["SecurityDelay"].astype("Int64")
df["LateAircraftDelay"] = df["LateAircraftDelay"].astype("Int64")
```
5 - Check Duplicated Values
```python
print(df.duplicated().sum())
```

6 - Check Null Values
```python
print(df.isnull().sum())
```
7 - Fill All Null Values
```python
df.fillna({"ArrTime":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"ActualElapsedTime":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"CRSElapsedTime":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"AirTime":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"ArrDelay":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"TaxiIn":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"TaxiOut":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"CarrierDelay":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"WeatherDelay":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"NASDelay":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"SecurityDelay":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"LateAircraftDelay":0}, inplace = True)
df.fillna({"TailNum":"Unknown"}, inplace = True)

print(df.isnull().sum())
```
8 - Export Cleaned CSV File
```python
df.to_csv('CleanedDelayedFlights.csv', index=False)
```

 <br />

- **Power BI: Data modeling, DAX measures, and building interactive dashboards**

Data Modeling:
- Make a star schema to improve analysis performance

DAX Measures:
```dax
Average Air Time = AVERAGE(FactDelayedFlights[AirTime])
```
```dax
Average Distance = AVERAGE(FactDelayedFlights[Distance])
```
```dax
Average TaxiIn = AVERAGE(FactDelayedFlights[TaxiIn])
```
```dax
Average TaxiOut = AVERAGE(FactDelayedFlights[TaxiOut])
```
```dax
Cancellation Rate = DIVIDE([Total Cancelled Flights],[Total Flights])
```
```dax
Diversion Rate = DIVIDE([Total Diverted Flights], [Total Flights])
```
```dax
Late Aircraft Delay Flights = CALCULATE([Total Flights], FactDelayedFlights[LateAircraftDelay]<> 0)
```
```dax
NAS Delay Flights = CALCULATE([Total Flights], FactDelayedFlights[NASDelay]<> 0)
```
```dax
Number of Airport = DISTINCTCOUNT(DimAirport[Airport Code])
```
```dax
Number of Carriers = DISTINCTCOUNT(DimCarrier[Carrier Code])
```
```dax
Security Delay Flights = CALCULATE([Total Flights], FactDelayedFlights[SecurityDelay]<> 0)
```
```dax
Total Air Time = SUM(FactDelayedFlights[AirTime])
```
```dax
Total Cancelled Flights = SUM(FactDelayedFlights[Cancelled])
```
```dax
Total Distance = SUM(FactDelayedFlights[Distance])
```
```dax
Total Diverted Flights = SUM(FactDelayedFlights[Diverted])
```
```dax
Total Flights = COUNT(FactDelayedFlights[ID])
```
```dax
Weather Delay Flights = CALCULATE([Total Flights], FactDelayedFlights[WeatherDelay]<> 0)
```

Reporting:
1. Make a star schema to improve analysis performance
2. Make a dimension for Date using a simple M language code
3. Make 5 reports to get valuable insights from data

 <br />
